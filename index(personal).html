        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="box">
            <img src="./resources/me.jpg" class="pics">
            <p>I live in Shirley, New York. I was born into a Portuguese speaking family, but I was raised and have lived on Long Island my whole life. I have many years of experience working as an electrician, but I have decided to return to school and I strive towards earning a CS degree and changing my career.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently a Computer Science Student at Suffolk County Community College. I will graduate in June 2023 and will hopefully continue my education at Stony Brook University. I plan on pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree with a specialization in data science. I am highly motivated and strive to learn as much as possible about computer programming and data research. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am also a student tutor for the Computer Science department at SCCC. I volunteer at Reading Partners, where I do my best to help children learn to read. I am also a member of Coastal Research and Education Society of Long Island, where I help keep census of the seals that haul out at Cupsogue Beach in WestHampton. </p>
